# Void Function

## C++ Void Function and Variables

Void function that receives FOUR int variables. First two by VALUE and last two by REFERENCE. Name formal parameters n1, n2, sum, and diff. Funtion calculates sum of the two variables passed by value and then store the result in the first variable passed by reference. It should also calculate the difference between the two variables passed by value and store the result in the second variable passed by reference. WHEN CALCULATING THE DIFFERENCE ALWAYS SUBTRACT THE SMALLER NUMBER FROM THE LARGER NUMBER. Name function calcSumAndDiff. Also write an appropriate function prototype for calcSumAndDiff function. In addition write a statement invoking calcSumAndDiff function and passing it to the variables.
